How to establish a bluetooth connection:

1.) Connect the bluetooth module to the arduinos
	1.1) Connect TX-0 to the D2 Port and RX-1 to D3 Port on the Arduino
2.) Load the programme "config_bluetooth_module" on both arduinos.
3.) Connect the arduinos in the command line by entering "C,<mac address>"
4.) The green "connect" leds should switch on
5.) Type something in the terminal
6.) Each other should see what the opposite arduino just wrote

Tip: You can write data via the command "bluetooth.print()"
